### my history

I'm Mark van der Broek, a Research Master student in Business Analytics and Econometrics. Technology has had my interest for as long as I can remember. I learned programming in HTML and CSS around age 12, which resulted in a few small hobby websites (that are not online anymore...). During my undergraduate degree in Econometrics and Operations Research I expanded my interest and knowledge in programming; I followed an intensive programming course in C++, and used the Python and the R language throughout my undergraduate. Applications ranged from scraping websites, cleaning and transforming data, and visualising results obtained by data analysis.
